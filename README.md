# Comic Generator App

Welcome to the Comic Generator app! This application allows users to input text, and it generates a comic based on the provided text.

## Getting Started

1. **Run Development Server:**
   - To start the development server, use one of the following commands:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     # or
     yarn dev
     # or
     pnpm dev
     # or
     bun dev
     ```
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the Comic Generator app.

2. **Generate Comic:**
   - Enter text in the input field provided on the main page.
   - Click the "Generate Comic" button to trigger the comic generation process.

3. **View Generated Comic:**
   - The generated comic will be displayed below the input field.

## Customization

- **Comic Generation Logic:**
  - The current example uses a simple logic to reverse the input text as a basic comic generation. You can customize the `generateComic` function in `pages/index.js` to implement more sophisticated comic generation logic based on your requirements.
